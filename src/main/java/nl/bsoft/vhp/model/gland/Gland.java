- Thyroid Gland: Located in the front of the neck, the thyroid gland is shaped like a butterfly and produces hormones that regulate metabolism, growth, and development.
- Parathyroid Glands: These four tiny glands sit behind the thyroid gland and produce parathyroid hormone, which helps regulate calcium levels in the blood.
- Adrenal Glands: Situated on top of the kidneys, the adrenal glands produce hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, which help manage stress, regulate blood sugar levels, and control blood pressure.
- Pituitary Gland: Often referred to as the "master gland," the pea-sized pituitary gland located at the base of the brain produces several hormones that control many other glands and their hormone production.
- Thymus Gland: Found in the chest cavity behind the breastbone, the thymus gland plays a vital role in the development of the immune system during childhood. It shrinks with age.
- Pineal Gland: Considered the smallest organ in the human body, the pineal gland sits deep within the brain and produces melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate sleep-wake cycles.
