# Plasma

## Blood plasma

- Blood plasma is the straw-colored liquid portion of your blood.
- It makes up about 55% of your total blood volume, with the remaining 45% being red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
- Think of it as the highway that carries all the important cargo throughout your body.

## What it's made of

- Plasma is about 91% water, but the other 9% is crucial.
- This 9% is a complex mixture of proteins, hormones, electrolytes (salts), and waste products.
- The proteins play a starring role, including:
  - [Albumin](albumin.md): The most abundant protein, responsible for transporting various substances and maintaining blood pressure.
  - Antibodies (immunoglobulins): Essential for fighting infection.
  - Clotting factors: Crucial for stopping bleeding after an injury.
  
## What it does

- Plasma's main function is transportation. It acts as a delivery system for:
    - Nutrients like glucose, amino acids, and fats to your cells.
    - Hormones produced by glands to reach their target organs.
    - Waste products like carbon dioxide to be eliminated by the lungs and kidneys.
- It also helps maintain blood volume and blood pressure.
- Plasma proteins are involved in various other functions, including:
  - Clotting blood to prevent excessive bleeding.
  - Fighting infections.
  - Maintaining the proper balance of fluids in your body.
  
## Plasma in medicine

- Plasma, rich in proteins and clotting factors, is a crucial component of blood transfusions.
- Donated plasma can be processed into different products used to treat various conditions, like:
  - Fresh frozen plasma (FFP): Used to replace clotting factors and proteins in people with deficiencies or severe bleeding.
  - Immune globulin: Used to boost the immune system and fight infections.

**In summary**  Plasma is the lifeblood of your circulatory system, transporting vital materials throughout your body and playing a critical role in maintaining health.
