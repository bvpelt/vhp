# Weight distribution

Organ weight distribution is a complex issue because several factors affect it, including:

- **Body weight and height**: Larger individuals tend to have heavier organs.
- **Lean body mass**: Muscle mass influences organ weight more than fat.
- **Race**: There may be slight variations in average organ weight between ethnicities.

Due to these variations, providing a single, definitive weight distribution for every organ is difficult. However,
here's some general information:

- **Sex**: On average, men tend to have slightly heavier organs than women due to their larger body size and muscle
  mass.
- **Age**: Organ weights tend to decrease with age, especially for the brain.

Here's a table with some average organ weights for men and women (remember these are averages and there can be
significant variations)

| Organ	     | Average Weight in Men (grams) | Average Weight in Women (grams) |
|------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Heart	  | 365	                          | 312                              |
| Liver	  | 1677	                         | 1475                             |
| Pancreas   | 	144	                         | 122                              |
| Right Lung | 	663                          | 	546                             |
| Left Lung  | 	624	                         | 488                              |
