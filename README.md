- Glands
  - Thyroid Gland: Located in the front of the neck, the thyroid gland is shaped like a butterfly and produces hormones that regulate metabolism, growth, and development. ![thyroid](doc/images/thyroid.jpeg "thyroid") 
  - Parathyroid Glands: These four tiny glands sit behind the thyroid gland and produce parathyroid hormone, which helps regulate calcium levels in the blood. ![parathyroid](doc/images/parathyroid.jpeg "parathyroid") 
  - Adrenal Glands: Situated on top of the kidneys, the adrenal glands produce hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, which help manage stress, regulate blood sugar levels, and control blood pressure. ![adrenal](doc/images/adrenal.jpeg "adrenal") pituitary
  - Pituitary Gland: Often referred to as the "master gland," the pea-sized pituitary gland located at the base of the brain produces several hormones that control many other glands and their hormone production. ![pituitary](doc/images/pituitary.jpeg "pituitary") thymus
  - Thymus Gland: Found in the chest cavity behind the breastbone, the thymus gland plays a vital role in the development of the immune system during childhood. It shrinks with age.![thymus](doc/images/thymus.jpeg "thymus") pineal
  - Pineal Gland: Considered the smallest organ in the human body, the pineal gland sits deep within the brain and produces melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate sleep-wake cycles. ![pineal](doc/images/pineal.jpeg "pineal")
