The major organs in the human body are:

- Organs
  - Brain: The brain is the control center of the nervous system and is responsible for everything we do, from thinking and feeling to moving and breathing.

  - Heart: The heart is a muscular organ that pumps blood throughout the body. It is the most important organ in the circulatory system.

    The heart is a vital muscular organ that acts as the powerhouse of your circulatory system. It's about the size of your fist and tirelessly pumps blood throughout your body, delivering oxygen and nutrients to your cells and tissues while carrying away waste products. Here's a deeper dive into its structure and function:
    
    Structure
    
    The heart is divided into four chambers:
    
    Atria (Upper Chambers): There are two atria, a right atrium and a left atrium. These thin-walled chambers act as receiving chambers, where blood from the body enters the heart through veins.
    Ventricles (Lower Chambers): The ventricles are thicker and more muscular than the atria. The right ventricle pumps blood to the lungs, where it picks up oxygen. The left ventricle, the strongest chamber, pumps oxygen-rich blood throughout the body through arteries.
    Valves within the heart ensure blood flows in one direction:
    
    Atrioventricular valves (Tricuspid and Mitral valves): These valves control the flow of blood between the atria and ventricles.
    Semilunar valves (Aortic and Pulmonary valves): These valves regulate blood flow out of the ventricles to the lungs and body.
    The heart is surrounded by a protective sac called the pericardium.
    
    Function
    
    The heart follows a rhythmic cycle of contraction and relaxation to pump blood:
    
    - Diastole (Relaxation): During diastole, the heart relaxes, and the atria fill with blood returning from the body (right atrium) and lungs (left atrium).
    - Systole (Contraction): In systole, the heart contracts, squeezing blood from the atria into the ventricles. The ventricles then contract with greater force, pumping blood out to the lungs (right ventricle) and body (left ventricle).
    
    The heart rate is the number of times the heart beats per minute and is influenced by factors like activity level, emotions, and medications.
    
    Interesting Facts:
    
    - The average heart rate for a healthy adult at rest is between 60 and 100 beats per minute.
    - The heart is one of the first organs to develop in the womb, beginning to beat as early as 6 weeks after conception.
    - Blood vessels are like a vast network of highways throughout your body, with a total length estimated to be over 60,000 miles if laid out end-to-end.
    
    Taking care of your heart is crucial for your overall health. Here are some tips:
    
    - Maintain a healthy diet.
    - Exercise regularly.
    - Manage stress.
    - Avoid smoking.
    - Get regular checkups with your doctor.
  - Lungs: The lungs are two spongy organs that allow us to breathe. They take in oxygen from the air and release carbon dioxide.

  - Liver: The liver is the largest organ in the body and is responsible for many important functions, including filtering blood, storing nutrients, and producing bile.

  - Kidneys: The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs that filter waste products from the blood and produce urine.

  - Stomach: The stomach is a muscular sac that breaks down food into a liquid mixture called chyme.

  - Intestines: The intestines are long, tube-shaped organs that absorb nutrients from food into the bloodstream.

  - Pancreas: The pancreas is a gland that produces digestive enzymes and hormones, including insulin.

- Glands
  - Thyroid Gland: Located in the front of the neck, the thyroid gland is shaped like a butterfly and produces hormones that regulate metabolism, growth, and development. ![thyroid](doc/images/thyroid.jpeg "thyroid") 
  - Parathyroid Glands: These four tiny glands sit behind the thyroid gland and produce parathyroid hormone, which helps regulate calcium levels in the blood. ![parathyroid](doc/images/parathyroid.jpeg "parathyroid") 
  - Adrenal Glands: Situated on top of the kidneys, the adrenal glands produce hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, which help manage stress, regulate blood sugar levels, and control blood pressure. ![adrenal](doc/images/adrenal.jpeg "adrenal") pituitary
  - Pituitary Gland: Often referred to as the "master gland," the pea-sized pituitary gland located at the base of the brain produces several hormones that control many other glands and their hormone production. ![pituitary](doc/images/pituitary.jpeg "pituitary") thymus
  - Thymus Gland: Found in the chest cavity behind the breastbone, the thymus gland plays a vital role in the development of the immune system during childhood. It shrinks with age.![thymus](doc/images/thymus.jpeg "thymus") pineal
  - Pineal Gland: Considered the smallest organ in the human body, the pineal gland sits deep within the brain and produces melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate sleep-wake cycles. ![pineal](doc/images/pineal.jpeg "pineal")
